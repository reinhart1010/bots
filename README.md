# Hello, World!

![The Buddies of the Shells logo, but ~destroyed by Mallory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17312341/119351470-ae61e900-bcca-11eb-9fb6-5980369aadac.png)

I'm <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code>, and sorry  for messing the current BOTS logo. My powers are too strong to fly and turning everyone to <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code>, including everyone who read this `README` file. **By the way, if you want to read this `README` in full color, try cloning this repository and opening the `README.md` file in supported code editor/IDE programs, such as Atom (with [Markdown Preview plugin](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview)) or Visual Studio Code.** You're doing it correctly if you can see the word <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code> in green, just like in our webcomics.

Welcome to our official repository for the **Buddies of The Shells**. Just like any other GitHub/GitLab repository, we have a `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and a bunch of files related to development and deployment chores (e.g. for [Anjing](https://github.com/reinhart1010/anjing), CPanel, Jenkins, JSHint, and more).

**This repository is further divided into submodules.** It's good that you **don't have to clone the entire contents of this repository** to read our stories or fixing a critical issue in our website. But, if you still want to have all of our goodness, clone this repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/reinhart1010/bots` with the latest version of Git (2.13 or later). Your current Git version can be checked by using `git --version`, and you can find instructions for older versions of Git (at least version 1.6.5 or later) on <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796927/how-to-git-clone-including-submodules>.

The <code style="color: #EAB308; font-weight: 700;">127.0.0.1</code> is our home, the home for <https://bots.reinhart1010.id>, and the home for all of our chatbots. Want to fix or improve them? Visit <https://github.com/reinhart1010/bots-127.0.0.1>, or the <code style="color: #EAB308; font-weight: 700;">127.0.0.1/</code> directory if you clone this repository with all of its submodules.

> It's currently powered by [Laravel](https://laravel.com), so contributions on that repository is welcome as long as you have a basic knowledge in how Laravel project directories are structured.

If you are looking to read our stories, simply visit or clone our <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">roothouse</code> repository at <https://github.com/reinhart1010/bots-roothouse>, or the <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">roothouse/</code> directory if you clone this repository with all of its submodules.

> Yes, the <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">roothouse</code> is only accessible for <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code> users, but remember that you are <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code>, too!
>
> **Still afraid to enter it?** Well, fine, let's make it official for you and me...
>
> I, <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code>, grant **you** access to enter, clone, and modify the <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">roothouse</code> with or without my permission under the current `LICENSE` terms of the <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">roothouse</code> at <https://github.com/reinhart1010/bots-roothouse/blob/master/LICENSE>.

> I am <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code>, you are <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code>, and may we always be <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code> forever.

The <code style="color: #0EA5E9; font-weight: 700;">SYSTEMDOCS</code> at <https://github.com/reinhart1010/bots-SYSTEMDOCS> has all the docs and tools you need.

> Note that it's fine to talk to <b style="color: #0EA5E9; font-weight: 700;">Nate</b> normally, but the **<code style="color: #0EA5E9; font-weight: 700;">SYSTEM</code> WANTS ALL FILE NAMES TO BE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS, FOR THE SAKE OF COMPATIBILITY WITH THE LEGENDARY [DISK OPERATING SYSTEM (DOS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_operating_system).** Please respect him by `cd`-ing, and adding new files/folders, and committing in that repository in ALL CAPS.

## Why does the `LICENSE` copyright year start from 2016, instead of 2021?
The first concept of these characters (primarily <b style="color: #0EA5E9">Nate</b> and <b style="color: #EC4899">Nix</b>) first begins as Charlie and Charlene in 2016, where they possess the magical powers of the Internet and rule a virtual kingdom against hackers and malware.

The legacy of the original story still lives up to today, with "magical" elements of computer systems such as <code style="color: #0EA5E9; font-weight: 700;">SYSTEM</code> and <code style="color: #00CC00; font-weight: 700;">root</code> which represent the highest user/account permission level in Windows NT and UNIX-based family of operating systems.
